Description: A highly-optimized version of VNC that can be used with performance-critical applications
 Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a remote display system that allows you to
 view and interact with a desktop environment that is running on a remote
 computer.  Using VNC, you can run graphical applications on a remote machine
 and send only the pixels generated by these applications to your local
 machine.  VNC is platform-independent and supports a wide variety of operating
 systems and architectures as both servers and clients.
 .
 TurboVNC is a high-speed version of VNC derived from TightVNC.  It contains
 a variant of Tight encoding that is tuned to maximize performance for image-
 intensive applications (such as VirtualGL, video applications, and image
 editors) while still providing excellent performance for other types of
 applications.  TurboVNC, in combination with VirtualGL, provides a complete
 solution for remotely displaying 3D applications with interactive performance.
